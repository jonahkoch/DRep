    "comment": "This proposal represents a critical strategic investment in Cardano's future scalability and ecosystem growth through Midgard, a Layer 2 rollup solution that directly addresses the network's capacity limitations while strengthening its economic foundation. As blockchain adoption accelerates and transaction volumes increase, Cardano requires robust scaling infrastructure to maintain competitiveness and support the next generation of decentralized applications and services.\nMidgard's economic model creates a virtuous cycle that benefits the entire Cardano ecosystem. Unlike other Layer 2 solutions that fragment economic activity away from the base layer, Midgard's design ensures that increased rollup usage translates directly to increased fee revenue for Cardano Layer 1. This alignment strengthens ADA's utility and value proposition while funding network security through enhanced staking rewards, creating sustainable long-term growth that benefits all stakeholders from individual users to stake pool operators.\nThe scaling capabilities provided by Midgard position Cardano to compete effectively in markets requiring high transaction throughput, such as decentralized finance, gaming, and micropayments. These use cases are currently constrained by Layer 1 capacity limitations, and Midgard removes these barriers while maintaining the security guarantees that distinguish Cardano from other platforms. This expanded capability opens new market opportunities and user segments that were previously inaccessible.\nMidgard complements Cardano's existing scaling roadmap by filling a crucial gap in the ecosystem's scaling architecture. While Hydra addresses specific state channel use cases and partnerchains provide sidechain functionality, rollups serve different application requirements and user preferences. This comprehensive scaling approach ensures Cardano can support diverse applications and workloads, from high-frequency trading to social media platforms, without forcing developers into suboptimal scaling solutions.\nThe proposal's alignment with Cardano's decentralization principles ensures that scaling does not compromise the network's core values. By maintaining permissionless participation and inheriting Cardano's censorship resistance, Midgard scales the network's capacity while preserving its fundamental characteristics. This approach contrasts sharply with other ecosystems where scaling often requires accepting centralization trade-offs or security compromises.\nFrom a competitive positioning perspective, Midgard provides Cardano with differentiated capabilities that other blockchain platforms cannot replicate. This technological moat creates sustainable competitive advantages in the Layer 2 market while positioning Cardano as the preferred platform for applications requiring both scalability and true decentralization. The uniqueness of this offering strengthens Cardano's market position and ecosystem attractiveness.\nThe timing of this investment aligns perfectly with broader market trends toward Layer 2 adoption. As institutional and enterprise users increasingly evaluate blockchain platforms for large-scale deployments, having proven, production-ready scaling solutions becomes essential for capturing these opportunities. Midgard ensures Cardano is positioned to compete for these high-value use cases rather than losing them to platforms with more mature scaling infrastructure.\nAnastasia Labs' track record within the Cardano ecosystem provides confidence in successful delivery and long-term maintenance. Their extensive contributions to ecosystem development and active involvement in major applications demonstrate alignment with Cardano's success and capability to deliver production-ready infrastructure. The team's existing progress on Midgard development reduces execution risk while accelerating time to market.\nThe governance framework ensures responsible stewardship of treasury funds through established oversight mechanisms, milestone-based delivery, and transparent reporting. This structured approach protects community investment while enabling the innovation necessary to maintain Cardano's competitive position in the rapidly evolving blockchain landscape.\nSupporting Midgard represents an essential investment in Cardano's ability to serve growing user demand, capture new market opportunities, and maintain technological leadership. The proposal addresses immediate scaling needs while positioning the ecosystem for long-term success in an increasingly competitive environment where scalability, security, and decentralization determine platform viability and adoption."
