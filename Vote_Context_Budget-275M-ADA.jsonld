    "comment": "I am voting yes on the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget - 275M ada Administered by Intersect. While I do not support each individual proposal encapsulated, I do understand the absolute urgency in moving the process forward and getting funds administered. The total amount requested (275 million ADA) is within the range set forth by the supported Net Change Limit Info Action.  The proposals included in this budget were approved by the majority of voting power of DReps who participated in the Ekklesia off chain polling process.   The funds are needed to continue important work which should not be delayed given this critical period in Cardano's development. The budget brings together 39 initiatives focused on development, infrastructure, and marketing, which all align with Cardanoâ€™s 2025 roadmap.  Furthermore, this is not a direct request for funds but a recognition that the combined budget is approved so that future Treasury Withdrawals for each 39 project can be submitted and approved individually.  In summary, the Intersect budget includes a broad set of proposals that are generally approved by the Cardano ecosystem, and while I may have reservations about some individual proposals, approving the budget doesn't automatically release funds, because DReps can re-evaluate specific items when the associated treasury withdrawal actions are submitted on chain. It is essential to not delay treasury expenditures any further."
