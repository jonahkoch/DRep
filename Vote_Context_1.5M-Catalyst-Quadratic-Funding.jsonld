    "comment": "This proposal introduces an innovative Extended Quadratic Funding mechanism that strategically complements Project Catalyst by addressing critical limitations in current blockchain funding approaches while operating at zero administrative cost. The model amplifies treasury impact by transforming traditional funding from sole treasury allocation to a multiplier effect where individual donations can increase available capital by fifty percent or more.\nThe democratized decision-making framework balances financial contribution with proven community impact through a sophisticated voting system combining donation amounts with reputation scores. This approach prevents wealth concentration from dominating funding decisions while maintaining meaningful participation incentives and implementing robust Sybil resistance through zero-knowledge proof KYC via Hyperledger Identus.\nThe proposal addresses known Catalyst pain points including concentrated voter power, inefficient milestone management, and inadequate impact reporting through standardized metrics tracking on-chain transactions, new wallet creation, and active user acquisition. This creates the first comprehensive dataset of innovation return on investment within the Cardano ecosystem, enabling data-driven optimization of future funding decisions.\nThe zero operational cost structure ensures one hundred percent of treasury funds reach projects directly, maximizing resource efficiency while introducing additional capital through individual donor participation. Tax-deductible donation options for qualified donors create unique incentives that extend funding reach beyond the traditional crypto ecosystem.\nSocious brings proven expertise through extensive experience with Project Catalyst, SingularityNet's Deep Funding, and GitCoin platforms, combined with enterprise-grade identity solutions currently serving thirteen universities. Their team includes Cardano Ambassadors and Constitutional Committee members with deep ecosystem knowledge and technical capabilities.\nThe sustainable value capture mechanism establishes voluntary contribution systems where funded projects share ecosystem value through equity stakes, token allocations, or revenue sharing agreements. The ambitious but achievable target of five percent annual returns within ten years aligns with venture capital industry standards while building long-term treasury sustainability.\nThe streamlined milestone management system uses token incentives and financial penalties to encourage prompt, accurate reviewer decisions while implementing decentralized dispute resolution mechanisms. This particularly benefits smaller funding requests that often struggle with lengthy approval processes.\nSupporting this proposal enhances Cardano's funding infrastructure through equitable resource distribution, increased participation, and transparent accountability mechanisms that complement existing structures while introducing innovative approaches to treasury impact maximization and ecosystem growth acceleration."
