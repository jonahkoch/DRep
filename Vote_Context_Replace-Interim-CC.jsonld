    "comment": "This proposal represents a critical transition from provisional governance to a fully community-elected Constitutional Committee, marking a foundational moment in Cardano's decentralization journey. The Interim Constitutional Committee served its essential purpose as a temporary oversight body during the initial governance framework deployment, but its time-limited mandate must now give way to democratically elected representation.\nThe election process conducted between May and July 2025 demonstrated the maturity of Cardano's governance infrastructure through transparent, verifiable procedures that engaged DReps in selecting seven qualified committee members. This community-driven and independently audited selection process facilitated through an Intersect funded voting tool establishes legitimate democratic foundations for ongoing governance operations.\nRatification is operationally essential to prevent governance paralysis beyond Epoch 580. Without this transition, governance actions requiring Constitutional Committee approval would stall, undermining Cardano's decision-making capacity and platform evolution. The newly elected committee ensures continuity of critical oversight functions while representing authentic community mandate rather than institutional appointment.\nThe staggered term structure provides institutional stability through gradual renewal rather than complete replacement, demonstrating thoughtful governance design that balances continuity with democratic refreshment. Members serve either 146 or 73-epoch terms based on election results, ensuring operational knowledge transfer while enabling periodic community input.\nThe transition from founding entities to community-elected representatives fulfills Cardano's constitutional mandate for decentralized governance while maintaining operational competence through qualified, engaged committee members. This evolution demonstrates the platform's commitment to genuine decentralization beyond mere technical architecture.\nThe elected committee brings diverse geographical representation and community perspectives that enhance governance legitimacy and decision-making quality. The selection through active DRep participation validates the effectiveness of Cardano's unique governance model and builds confidence in future electoral processes.\nSupporting this proposal affirms collective commitment to constitutional governance principles while ensuring operational continuity essential for platform development. The combination of democratic legitimacy, operational necessity, and constitutional compliance makes ratification both practically essential and philosophically aligned with Cardano's founding principles.\nThis governance action represents the successful maturation of experimental governance structures into permanent, community-controlled institutions that will guide Cardano's continued evolution through legitimate, accountable oversight mechanisms."
