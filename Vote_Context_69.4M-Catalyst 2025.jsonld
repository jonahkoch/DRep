    "comment": "This proposal represents essential infrastructure investment to sustain and evolve Catalyst as Cardano's primary decentralized funding mechanism. With over four years of proven operation, the Catalyst team has successfully allocated ₳290 million across 2,091 projects in 114 countries, demonstrating reliable stewardship of treasury resources and ecosystem development.\nThe three-workstream approach addresses critical operational challenges while positioning Catalyst for long-term sustainability. Current manual processes create inefficiencies that this proposal aims to reduce by up to 50% through automation and improved tooling. The Hermes decentralized infrastructure replaces legacy systems with peer-to-peer architecture, aligning with Cardano's decentralization principles while improving resilience and scalability.\nCatalyst serves as the ecosystem's innovation engine, providing funding pathways for hundreds of builders and startups that drive Cardano's growth. The proposed ₳61 million across three funding rounds, including Retroactive Public Goods Funding, ensures continued support for early-stage research, open-source development, and community initiatives that might otherwise lack funding sources.\nThe proposal addresses governance concerns through planned reforms including quadratic voting and improved delegation mechanisms that reduce voting power concentration and increase participation equity. Enhanced mobile-first interfaces lower barriers to participation, particularly important for global adoption and community engagement.\nOperational improvements and interface development create a more accessible, scalable platform that can handle increased participation as the ecosystem grows. The investment in production-grade infrastructure ensures Catalyst can support larger funding volumes and more complex governance requirements without compromising performance or security.\nThe team's track record of processing over 3 million governance decisions and facilitating 12,000 individual payments demonstrates operational competence and financial integrity. Their commitment to transparency through on-chain tracking and community dashboards provides accountability for treasury fund usage.\nSupporting this proposal ensures Catalyst's continued evolution from experimental funding platform to mature, efficient infrastructure capable of supporting Cardano's growing developer and entrepreneur community. The investment in sustainability and decentralization aligns with broader ecosystem goals while maintaining the innovation funding pipeline essential for continued growth and competitiveness."
