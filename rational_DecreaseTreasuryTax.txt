I am voting no not because I disagree with the concept, but because I believe at this point in the development cycle of the ecosystem it is not appropriate.  I would prefer an incremental approach that would be less disruptive, and the Protocol Parameter Governance Action Type as proposed does not fully comply with the requirements put forward in the Cardano Constitution.

A healthy treasury is needed for network stability and future growth of the ecosystem.  These early stages of ecosystem development, will require accelerated treasury spending, so keeping expansion at the current rate maintains ecosystem stability.  It is essential to understand the ecosystem requirements before making changes to treasury funding. 

The negative impact on defi activities and TVL growth will degrade Cardano's market share to competitive ecosystems with more active and lucrative defi markets.  Additionally defi activities are the primary driver of all transaction volume in the ecosystem.  Reducing transaction volume will have a negative knock on effect to treasury growth degrading ecosystem stability.  Furthermore, defi yields need to be more competitive than staking rewards to attract liquidity provisions to and within the ecosystem.

What about Basho?  I do not consider the Cardano roadmap completed until we have addressed the Basho era.  There are several scaling enhancements that need to be fully developed and implemented, until we know the costs or have them completed we need to maintain a healthy and growing treasury.

When the ADA crypto currency can hold a $1 USD floor for more than 12 months I would consider that a sufficient fiat valuation threshold to justify a reduction in tau as it relates to price in fiat.

The Cardano network is still bootstrapping and has not fully developed its' roadmap, and why it still requires significant ecosystem adoption before it can safely reduce the current admittedly high tau for treasury funding.
