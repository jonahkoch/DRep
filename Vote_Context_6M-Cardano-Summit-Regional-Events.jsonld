    "comment": "This proposal addresses a critical gap in Cardano's global marketing strategy by establishing unified, professional brand presence across key international markets through a coordinated series of regional tech events and a flagship European summit. Cardano has historically lacked centralized representation at major blockchain conferences, resulting in fragmented messaging and diminished brand recognition compared to competing Layer 1 platforms.\nThe strategic approach leverages trusted ecosystem partners including Cardano Foundation, EMURGO, Rare Evo, WADA, and ADA Solar to execute regionally focused events that maintain brand consistency while addressing local market needs. This consortium brings proven track records in large-scale event delivery, from the Cardano Foundation's three successful global summits to EMURGO's TOKEN2049 participation and regional partners' community engagement expertise.\nThe global campaign addresses multiple ecosystem challenges simultaneously through targeted developer onboarding via Dev Days and hackathons, enterprise education initiatives, real-world use case showcasing, and strategic partnership development. These activities directly combat the persistent narrative that building on Cardano is difficult while demonstrating tangible utility to mainstream audiences and potential enterprise adopters.\nThe investment scale enables meaningful impact across five major regions with attendee targets of 500-800 per event, creating sufficient market presence to compete effectively with other blockchain platforms' marketing efforts. Regional autonomy ensures cultural relevance while maintaining unified Cardano branding and messaging consistency.\nCapital attraction, talent acquisition, and media coverage represent essential outcomes for ecosystem growth that require professional, large-scale marketing initiatives beyond community-driven efforts. The summit structure creates networking opportunities between developers, entrepreneurs, enterprises, and regulatory bodies that facilitate strategic partnerships and collaborative solutions to scaling challenges.\nThe governance framework provides appropriate oversight through audited smart contracts, multi-party committees, and milestone-based payments with third-party assurance, ensuring responsible treasury fund management while enabling professional event execution.\nSupporting this proposal strengthens Cardano's competitive positioning in global markets through unified brand presence, developer engagement, and enterprise outreach that directly contributes to adoption acceleration and ecosystem growth. The combination of professional execution capability, strategic market coverage, and transparent governance makes this investment essential for maintaining Cardano's visibility and attractiveness in an increasingly competitive blockchain landscape."
