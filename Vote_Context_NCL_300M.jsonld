    "comment": "I am voting no on this net change limit action because I believe it is too low of a treasury expenditure when faced with the current development requirements of the Cardano ecosystem.  My primary focus in decision making currently revolves around increasing transactions in both volume and type.  Cardano has not yet fully realized the original road map and still needs to fully implement Basho era advancements and upgrades.  Current restrictions on speed and transaction volume are severely inhibiting adoption of the Cardano ecosystem and its overall marketshare of the crypto domain space. The Cardano treasury is projected to grow by about 320 million ADA in 2025, therefore setting a NCL of 300 million ADA is too conservative at this stage in Cardano's development."
