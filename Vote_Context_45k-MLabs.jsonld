    "comment": "I have voted in favor of this action to demonstrates my intention to execute without delays and move the treasury expenditure process forward. I also want to note that I will not consider individual requests from the treasury for less that 100,000 ADA moving forward.  I reserve the right this round because I feel the process was not properly explained to proposers and DRep and it would be unfair to implement this guardrail at this time. Requests below that threshold are better suited for Catalyst funding. \nA budget and all included line items has already been approved, and now is the time to disperse funding and enable further development of the Cardano network. The proposal was selected through a well-defined process, and I will fully support it out of respect for the will of the broader Cardano community and a belief in respecting the consensus we achieved together under the Intersect-administered budget process. The process reflects a coordinated, strategic approach to funding Cardano’s ecosystem-critical infrastructure. The community has thoroughly reviewed the proposal. I was actively involved in the entire process and the proposal presented represents development that provides a tangible benefit to our ecosystem.  It would be a mistake to underfund our ecosystem’s development when we can sustainably provide the required funding with our available treasury reserves.\nFurthermore there are exceptional oversight mechanisms in place to ensure a minimum amount of wast, fraud, and abuse of treasury expenditures, such as Intersect’s smart contract framework (audited by TxPipe and MLabs), Multi-party oversight (including Cardano Foundation, Sundae Labs, NMKR, etc.), A clear milestone-driven disbursement model, and full transparency via TRSC/PSSC dashboards.\nThese governance and assurance systems meet the constitutional standards for accountability and risk management and provide confidence in efficiency and execution."
