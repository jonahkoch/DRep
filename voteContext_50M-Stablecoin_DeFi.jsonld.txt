    "comment": "I'm voting yes because Cardano's DeFi ecosystem suffers from a fatal weakness: anemic stablecoin liquidity. This proposal deploys 50 million ADA to solve it, and not as a handout, but as infrastructure investment that generates 4% annual returns back to the treasury while cutting stablecoin slippage in half. The current 4-6% slippage on trades makes Cardano uncompetitive and chokes user onboarding. Deep stablecoin liquidity isn't optional; it's the difference between a viable financial layer and a ghost chain.\nThe structure mitigates risk: a nine-person committee (including CF, EMURGO, IOHK reps) manages deployment through a 5-of-9 multisig, while a treasury DAO composed of DReps holds veto power to freeze spending or shut down the fund entirely. All liquidity tokens sit on-chain in the governing contract, that is publicly auditable, no black boxes. The proposal phases work intelligently: 500K ADA covers legal setup, smart contract development, and audits before the remaining 49.5M touches DeFi protocols. ADA liquidation uses OTC desks and gradual sales to avoid price shock, ADA is spread across exchanges with 30M+ daily volume, the impact is negligible.\nThis isn't picking winners arbitrarily; protocols apply and demonstrate security, yield potential, and growth plans. The committee evaluates openly with tDAO oversight. Yes, there's centralization risk in a small committee, but the alternative is permanent liquidity stagnation, which guarantees failure. The legal framework and governance contracts become reusable public goods for future treasury initiatives. We learn, adapt, or shut it down if KPIs aren't met. Perfect is the enemy of good, and Cardano can't wait for flawless proposals while competitors eat our lunch. Letâ€™s get it done."
