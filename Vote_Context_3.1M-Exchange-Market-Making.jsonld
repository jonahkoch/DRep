    "comment": "This proposal raises concerns about the appropriate use of treasury funds for market-making services and exchange listings that primarily benefit selected private commercial projects rather than the broader Cardano ecosystem. The fundamental issue lies in using public treasury resources to subsidize centralized exchange listings and market-making services that represent private commercial risks rather than public infrastructure investments. It has been demonstrated that Cardano native tokens can achieve tier-one exchange listings through strategic project execution, as evidenced by SNEK's successful Kraken listing without treasury intervention. This precedent suggests that viable projects with strong fundamentals can secure exchange partnerships through merit-based approaches rather than requiring subsidization from community funds. The allocation structure lacks transparency and community governance in token selection processes, creating a system where treasury funds support a limited number of predetermined projects without clear participation pathways for the broader developer community. This approach risks creating market distortions by selecting winners and losers rather than supporting infrastructure that benefits all ecosystem participants equally. The proposed budget allocation of up to one and a half million dollars for exchange listing fees represents substantial treasury expenditure with unclear return on investment or measurable ecosystem growth targets. Without specific key performance indicators, success measurements, or repayment mechanisms, these expenditures constitute grants to private commercial enterprises rather than strategic infrastructure investments. Treasury funds should prioritize reinforcing decentralized infrastructure, on-chain liquidity solutions, and reusable development tools that create lasting value for the entire ecosystem rather than subsidizing centralized services that primarily benefit individual token projects. Supporting market-making services for selected tokens does not materially contribute to protocol sustainability or broader network effects. The proposal lacks accountability mechanisms including treasury repayment plans, performance benchmarks, or community oversight of service allocation decisions. Public funds should not underwrite private commercial risks without corresponding public benefits and accountability structures that ensure responsible stewardship of community resources. A more appropriate approach would involve treasury loans with repayment expectations rather than outright grants, enabling support for promising projects while protecting community resources and establishing precedents for responsible treasury utilization. Supporting this proposal would set concerning precedents for treasury fund allocation that prioritizes private commercial interests over public infrastructure development and ecosystem-wide benefits."
