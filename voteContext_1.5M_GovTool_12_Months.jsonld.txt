    "comment": "I'm voting yes because GovTool is the infrastructure that makes Cardano governance operational, in my mind this is not optional, but operational. Without an open-source, community-owned platform, governance fragments into proprietary tools controlled by private interests, and decentralization becomes theater. GovTool already serves 50,000+ users across 170 countries, processing thousands of governance transactions. It's the UX backbone that lets ADA holders register, delegate, propose, vote, and audit outcomes transparently. Letting it degrade or privatize would be governance malpractice.\nThe 1.15 million ADA funds 12 months of hosting, infrastructure maintenance, active development across all governance pillars, and contributor incentives distributed transparently via Andamio platform. This isn't bloat, it's staffing the operating system of on-chain democracy. The roadmap delivers group DRep support (coalition building to distribute voting power), DRep voting history (liquid democracy accountability), Constitutional Committee vote tracking, crowdfunded governance action deposits via CoSponsor, and expanded APIs for third-party builders. These aren't vanity features; they're critical infrastructure that lowers barriers and distributes participation.\nIntersect administers funds through audited smart contracts with milestone-based disbursement and oversight from Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Xerberus, and NMKR. All fund flows are publicly auditable at cardanotreasury.fi, and unused funds return to treasury. The GovTool Consortium of LidoNation, ByronNetwork, WeDeliver, Dquadrant have the experience of building this through SanchoNet, Voltaire, and Chang upgrades with open-source code and global contributors. This is a strategic investment in Cardano's democratic operating layer, not simply maintenance expense or just another one of many. There is only this one."
