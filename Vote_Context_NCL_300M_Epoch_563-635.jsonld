    "comment": "I'm voting yes on the proposal to, Set a 300 million ADA Net Change Limit for Epochs 563–635. Setting the NCL at 300 million ADA matches the expected annual treasury inflow, ensuring that we maintain fiscal responsibility while still enabling meaningful investment in Cardano’s continued growth. This figure strikes the right balance between prudent spending and supporting the ecosystem’s development needs. I also appreciate the structuring of this NCL to cover the remainder of 2025 as well as a significant portion of 2026, thus moving the budgetary cycle away from the calendar year end and holiday seasons.  Moving key decision making processes to a summer fall cadence will make for more reliable participation.  This approach also provides continuity for ongoing and upcoming budget proposals, many of which are designed around 12-month cycles."
