    "comment": "This proposal addresses a critical funding gap in Cardano's ecosystem by establishing dedicated support for live, user-facing applications that drive real adoption, transaction volume, and Total Value Locked on mainnet. While Project Catalyst effectively supports early-stage innovation and core development budgets maintain protocol advancement, no existing mechanism provides sustained financial backing for established decentralized applications that are already generating measurable on-chain activity and user engagement.\nThe Cardano Builder DAO creates a complementary funding structure that enables Project Catalyst to focus more effectively on experimentation and innovation by providing an alternative pathway for mature projects that have demonstrated market fit and user adoption. This strategic separation optimizes the entire ecosystem funding framework by matching project development stages with appropriate support mechanisms.\nThe proposal's metrics-first approach ensures accountability through transparent tracking of key performance indicators including transaction counts, active users, and Total Value Locked. This data-driven methodology enables the community to measure return on investment while ensuring funded projects contribute meaningfully to ecosystem growth and competitive positioning.\nThe team's proven track record with Clarity governance platform and Agora smart contracts provides confidence in execution capability. Their infrastructure has successfully governed over ten million dollars in TVL across four production DAOs, demonstrating operational competence in decentralized treasury management and member-based governance systems.\nThe multi-signature structure requiring approval from three of four scope leads plus leadership provides robust safeguards against misallocation while maintaining efficient decision-making processes. Combined with Intersect's administration and proven smart contract controls, this governance framework ensures responsible stewardship of treasury funds.\nSupporting established projects with demonstrated user adoption and on-chain activity directly contributes to Cardano's competitive positioning by maintaining ecosystem momentum and preventing migration to platforms with better funding infrastructure. High-impact applications attract users, generate transaction volume, and create network effects that benefit the entire ecosystem.\nThe strategic value extends beyond individual project support to ecosystem-wide benefits including increased block space utilization, higher Total Value Locked, improved user retention, and enhanced visibility in the broader Web3 landscape. These outcomes strengthen Cardano's market position while creating sustainable foundations for continued growth.\nThis proposal represents essential infrastructure for maintaining and accelerating application-layer development that drives real-world adoption and utility, making it a strategic investment in Cardano's long-term competitive success."
