    "comment": "This proposal represents essential infrastructure investment for maintaining Cardano's operational continuity and governance effectiveness during the critical transition period from founding organization control to fully decentralized community governance. Intersect serves as the neutral coordination layer that bridges on-chain voting mechanisms with practical ecosystem management, ensuring that constitutional frameworks translate into functional network operations.\nIntersect's stewardship of core Haskell codebases powering Cardano nodes requires sustained technical expertise and institutional continuity that cannot be effectively replaced through ad-hoc arrangements. Their coordination of ecosystem-wide upgrades, including the successful Chang and Plomin hard forks, demonstrates proven capability in managing complex technical deployments that require alignment across infrastructure providers, stake pool operators, decentralized applications, and exchanges globally.\nThe Administrator role defined in the Constitution requires a reliable institutional counterparty capable of managing treasury-funded initiatives, providing contract oversight, ensuring compliance monitoring, and facilitating transparent delivery assurance. Intersect's established framework for proposal vetting, operational execution, and smart contract development provides essential infrastructure for responsible treasury fund management while supporting increased decentralization over time.\nThe facilitation of over thirty working groups and eight elected committees creates practical pathways for community participation in governance beyond simple voting mechanisms. These structures enable specialized expertise development, collaborative problem-solving, and informed recommendation generation that enhances the quality of on-chain decision-making while building governance capacity across the ecosystem.\nBudget and roadmap coordination functions ensure strategic alignment between technical development priorities and community needs through transparent processes that enable informed treasury allocation decisions. The Product Committee's facilitation of long-term ecosystem vision development and the structured approach to future budget preparation provide essential planning infrastructure for sustainable growth.\nThe support for Constitutional Committee elections, DRep onboarding, and stakeholder coordination ensures that governance mechanisms function effectively while building institutional knowledge and operational capacity necessary for continued decentralization. Intersect's role in expanding ecosystem capacity through supporting new member-based organizations creates pathways for governance pluralization and reduced dependency on single institutions.\nThe interim leadership transition under Jack Briggs demonstrates commitment to lean, accountable operations focused on community service rather than institutional expansion. This approach aligns with Cardano's decentralization principles while maintaining operational effectiveness necessary for network stability and governance continuity.\nSupporting this proposal ensures sustained coordination infrastructure essential for Cardano's governance maturation, technical development continuity, and community participation facilitation during the foundational period of decentralized network management."
