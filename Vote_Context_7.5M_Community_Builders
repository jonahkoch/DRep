    "comment": "I’m voting no on the 2025 Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget - 7.5M ₳ for community builders.  This proposal is submitted by a third party without providing evidence of formal agreements with all the parties named to undertake the proposed commitments.  It therefore does not satisfy the requirement for a specified administration partner.  I also find this proposal flawed in that, it lacks transparency and I have concerns about how accurately the proposal reflects the intentions of the named contributors. Therefore I don't have confidence in the proposal’s ability to deliver on its goals effectively and responsibly."
