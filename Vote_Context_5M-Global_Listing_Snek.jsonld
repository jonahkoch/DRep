    "comment": "I am voting to abstain on this proposal, not from opposition to SNEK's mission, but from a commitment to strict principles in treasury management. As both a SNEK holder and Cardano ecosystem supporter, I believe in measuring, testing, and proving value before large-scale investment.\nThe time to test an investment is before you spend your money. SNEK has proven concept with $4M self-investment and successful major exchange listings, but we need controlled testing of smaller treasury allocations with measurable results before committing 5M ADA to unproven returns.\nThe only purpose of treasury investment is to generate ecosystem value. It is profitable or unprofitable according to its actual returns. What are the measurable benefits to the Cardano ecosystem per ADA invested? The current proposal lacks commitment to repay or share profits with the treasury. This fails the fundamental standard that public investments should generate quantifiable returns.\nSNEK drives trading volume and user engagement, but it remains unproven whether 5M ADA investment yields proportional ecosystem benefits. We lack controlled data comparing exchange versus decentralized trading impact on Cardano fees. Never fund campaigns where the public takes all the risk while private interests take all the profits. Here, the treasury risks 5M ADA with no repayment clause while the SNEK team benefits from enhanced token liquidity, exchanges profit from listing fees and trading revenue, and ecosystem benefits remain indirect, unmeasured, and unguaranteed.\nInstead of a 5M ADA grant, offer this as a loan repayable from listing success, with trading fee percentages returned to treasury, aligning private profits with public benefit.\nBefore any funding, establish baseline metrics for current Cardano transaction fees, trading volumes, and wallet creation. Define success through minimum ecosystem ROI thresholds and require monthly transparent impact reports with verifiable data. Answer the fundamental questions: What exact results do you expect per dollar spent? How will you measure success versus failure? What controlled test proves this works? Who profits from this investment?\nI abstain because I believe in SNEK's potential but demand rigor in treasury allocation. The Cardano ecosystem deserves measured, tested, profitable investments, not hopeful gambles with public funds. Test small, measure carefully, prove value scientifically, then scale with confidence. This builds a sustainable, profitable ecosystem benefiting all stakeholders, not just token holders.\nApply scientific principles to treasury management. Protect the ecosystem while enabling genuine innovation to flourish through proven, measurable success. When investments generate verified returns, everyone profits. When they fail rigorous testing, everyone is protected."
